Relationships:-
------------------

Region (parent) --> countries (child)
   
Countries (parent) --> locations (child)

Locations (parent) --> departments (child)

Departments (parent) --> employees, job_history (child)

Employees (parent) --> job_history (child)

Jobs (parent) --> employees, job_history (child)

Perfect! Let’s break down your relationships step by step so you can visualize the hierarchy clearly. I’ll also mention the type of relationships (1:1, 1:M, M:M) for clarity.

1. Region → Countries

Parent: Region

Child: Countries

Relationship: 1 Region → Many Countries (1:M)

Reason: A single region can have multiple countries.

2. Countries → Locations

Parent: Countries

Child: Locations

Relationship: 1 Country → Many Locations (1:M)

Reason: Each country can have multiple office locations.

3. Locations → Departments

Parent: Locations

Child: Departments

Relationship: 1 Location → Many Departments (1:M)

Reason: Each office location can host multiple departments.

4. Departments → Employees, Job_History

Parent: Departments

Child: Employees, Job_History

Relationship:

Departments → Employees: 1 Department → Many Employees (1:M)

Departments → Job_History: 1 Department → Many Job History records (1:M)

Reason: Employees belong to a department; job changes are tracked per department.

5. Employees → Job_History

Parent: Employees

Child: Job_History

Relationship: 1 Employee → Many Job_History records (1:M)

Reason: Each employee can have multiple past job records.

6. Jobs → Employees, Job_History

Parent: Jobs

Child: Employees, Job_History

Relationship:

Jobs → Employees: 1 Job → Many Employees (1:M)

Jobs → Job_History: 1 Job → Many Job History records (1:M)

Reason: Many employees can have the same job, and job history tracks this over time.

✅ Summary:

The hierarchy looks like this:

Region
 └─ Countries
      └─ Locations
           └─ Departments
                ├─ Employees
                │    └─ Job_History
                └─ Job_History
Jobs ──────────┘


If you want, I can draw an ER diagram for you showing all parent-child relationships with PK-FK links, so it’s visually easier to understand.
